==========

Dataset containing 1-year of energy consumption of a household in the north of France. 

The `raw` dataset is composed of several files containing `eletrcicity`, `gas`, `indoor`/`outdoor` temperature measurements for different periods of the year. For simplicity, these files were cleaned and agregated into a single file per sensor type.

Details about the cleaning operations are available at the [Triple-A-household-energy-analysis](https://github.com/javieraespinosa/Triple-A-household-energy-analysis) repository.
